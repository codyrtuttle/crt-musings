This is a blog of my short musings - thoughts that I have that I want to write and get out there, little bits of code that I'm working through that I want to have a record of, short reflections on data, research, policy or life. This is a sub-project of my primary blog site, which you can visit if you want longer form posts, usually with code and such.
